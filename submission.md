# Submission – Project Development Assignment

## 1. Tool I Used
I used StarUML to create the UML class diagram and generate the initial Python code.  
I used VS Code to open, edit, and run the Python files.  
I also used ChatGPT (AI) to fix errors and help me complete the missing logic.

## 2. Difficulties I Faced
- At first, I didn’t know how to draw relationships in StarUML.
- StarUML generated Java files, so I had to install the Python code generator.
- I had import errors in Python until I placed all files in the same folder.
- I did not know how to upload to GitHub correctly and needed guidance.
- Some generated functions were empty, so I had to write the logic myself.

## 3. Accuracy of the Generated Code
The generated code was only basic structure.  
It created:
- classes
- attributes
- empty methods

But it did not generate real logic.  
I had to write the similarity calculation, assignment objects, and main program manually.

## 4. Remaining Work Needed
To make the project a complete Version 1, it still needs:
- better similarity algorithm
- reading assignment files from a folder
- printing a full report
- exception handling
- more testing

## 5. GitHub Upload
I uploaded all generated and modified Python files to my Github repository:
https://github.com/IshaNeupane/Software-engineering-project

I used:
- “Add file → Upload files” from GitHub website  
- Then committed the changes
